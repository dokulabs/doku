## Create Image

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import dokumetry

client = OpenAI()

# Pass the above `client` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all OpenAI calls are automatically tracked.
dokumetry.init(llm=client, doku_url="YOUR_DOKU_URL", api_key="YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN")

client.images.generate(
  model="dall-e-3",
  prompt="A cute baby sea otter",
  n=1,
  size="1024x1024"
)
```

## Create Image Variation
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import dokumetry

client = OpenAI()

# Pass the above `client` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all OpenAI calls are automatically tracked.
dokumetry.init(llm=client, doku_url="YOUR_DOKU_URL", api_key="YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN")

response = client.images.create_variation(
  image=open("image_edit_original.png", "rb"),
  n=2,
  size="1024x1024"
)
```

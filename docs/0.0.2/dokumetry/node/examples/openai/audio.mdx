## Create Speech

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import DokuMetry from 'dokumetry';

const openai = new OpenAI();

// Pass the above `openai` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all OpenAI calls are automatically tracked.
DokuMetry.init({llm: openai, dokuURL: "YOUR_DOKU_URL", apiKey: "YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN"})

const speechFile = path.resolve("./speech.mp3");

async function main() {
  const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
    model: "tts-1",
    voice: "alloy",
    input: "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
  });
  console.log(speechFile);
  const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer());
  await fs.promises.writeFile(speechFile, buffer);
}
main();
```

OpenLIT SDKs provide OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation for monitoring LLM Application using Cohere which includes performance, token and cost usage and user interactions.

The integration is compatible with  
- Cohere Python SDK client `>= 5.3.0` 

## Get Started 

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the OpenLIT Python SDK using pip">
      ```shell
      pip install openlit
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following two lines to your application code:">
      Integrating the OpenLIT into LLM applications is straightforward. Start monitoring for your LLM Application with just **one line of code**: 

      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init(otlp_endpoint="otlp_backend_endpoint", otlp_headers="otlp_backend_token")
      ```

      Alternatively, you can configure the OTLP endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and the OTLP headers by setting the Appli`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environmentcation variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

      If your aim is primarily to test or develop without sending telemetry data to an external backend, you can initialize OpenLIT without any parameters. This approach directs all telemetry output to your console, enabling quick diagnostics and local debugging:
      
      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init()
      ```
      
      Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.

## Generate

```python
import cohere
import dokumetry

co = cohere.Client('<<apiKey>>')

# Pass the above `co` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all Cohere calls are automatically tracked.
dokumetry.init(llm=co, doku_url="YOUR_DOKU_URL", api_key="YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN")

response = co.generate(
  prompt='Please explain to me how LLMs work',
)
print(response)

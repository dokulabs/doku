## Create Embeddings

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import dokumetry

client = OpenAI()

# Pass the above `client` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all OpenAI calls are automatically tracked.
dokumetry.init(llm=client, doku_url="YOUR_DOKU_URL", api_key="YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN")

client.embeddings.create(
  model="text-embedding-ada-002",
  input="The food was delicious and the waiter...",
  encoding_format="float"
)
```

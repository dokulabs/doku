OpenLIT is an **OpenTelemetry-native** GenAI and LLM Application Observability tool. It's designed to make the integration process of observability into GenAI projects as easy as pie ‚Äì literally, with just **a single line of code**. Whether you're working with popular LLM Libraries such as OpenAI and HuggingFace or leveraging vector databases like ChromaDB, OpenLIT ensures your applications are monitored seamlessly, providing critical insights to improve performance and reliability.

This project proudly follows the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) of the OpenTelemetry community, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in observability.

## What is LIT?
LIT stands for Learning Interpretability Tool. It refers to a visual, interactive model-understanding and data visualization tool ad  a term introduced by [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#learning-interpretability-tool-lit).

## ‚ö° Features
- **OpenTelemetry-native**: Native support ensures that integrating OpenLIT into your projects feels more like a natural extension rather than an additional layer of complexity.
- **Granular Usage Insights of your LLM Applications**: Assess your LLM's performance and costs with fine-grained control, breaking down metrics by environment (such as staging or production) or application, to optimize for efficiency and scalability.
- **Vendor-Neutral SDKs**: In the spirit of OpenTelemetry, OpenLIT's SDKs are agnostic of the backend vendors. This means you can confidently use OpenLIT with various telemetry backends, like Grafana Tempo, without worrying about compatibility issues.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## Step 1: Install OpenLIT SDK

```bash
pip install openlit
```

### Step 2: Instrument your Application
Integrating the OpenLIT into LLM applications is straightforward. Start monitoring for your LLM Application with just **one line of code**: 

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

By default, OpenLIT directs traces and metrics straight to your console. To forward telemetry data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint, such as the OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `otlp_endpoint` parameter with the desired endpoint. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

To send telemetry to OpenTelemetry backends requiring authentication, set the `otlp_headers` parameter with its desired value. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

#### Example

Here is how you can send telemetry from OpenLIT to Grafana Cloud

```python
openlit.init(
  otlp_endpoint="https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/otlp", 
  otlp_headers="Authorization=Basic%20<base64 encoded Instance ID and API Token>"
)
```

Alternatively, You can also choose to set these values using `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variables

```python
openlit.init()
```

```env
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/otlp"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = "Authorization=Basic%20<base64 encoded Instance ID and API Token>"
```

### Step 3: Visualize and Optimize!
With the LLM Observability data now being collected and sent to your chosen OpenTelemetry backend, the next step is to visualize and analyze this data to glean insights into your application's performance, behavior, and identify areas of improvement. Here is how you would use the data in Grafana, follow these detailed instructions to explore your LLM application's Telemetry data.

   - Select the **Explore** option from Grafana's sidebar.
   - At the top, ensure the correct Tempo data source is selected from the dropdown menu.
   - Use the **Query** field to specify any particular traces you are interested in, or leave it empty to browse through all the available traces.
   - You can adjust the time range to focus on specific periods of interest.
   - Hit **Run Query** to fetch your trace data. You'll see a visual representation of your traces along with detailed information on particular spans when clicked.

#### Next Steps

- **Create Dashboards:** Beyond just exploring traces, consider creating dashboards in Grafana to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics over time. Dashboards can be customized with various panels to display graphs, logs, and single stats that are most relevant to your application's performance and usage patterns.
- **Set Alerts:** Grafana also allows you to set up alerts based on specific thresholds. This feature can be invaluable in proactively managing your application's health by notifying you of potential issues before they impact users.
- **Iterate and Optimize:** Use the insights gained from your observability data to make informed decisions on optimizing your LLM application. This might involve refining model parameters, adjusting scaling strategies, or identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

Mistral Test Suite

This module contains a suite of tests for Mistral functionality 
using the Mistral Python library. It includes tests for various 
Mistral API endpoints such as chat and embeddings creation.

The tests are designed to cover different aspects of Mistral's 
capabilities and serve as a validation mechanism for the integration 
with the Doku monitoring system.

Global Mistral client and initialization are set up for the 
Mistral client and Doku monitoring.

Environment Variables:
    - Mistral_API_TOKEN: Mistral API api_key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment variables are properly set before running the tests.
